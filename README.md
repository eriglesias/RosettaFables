## ðŸ“– What is this?

This project analyzes Aesop's fables in multiple languages (English, German, Dutch, Spanish, and Ancient Greek) to discover interesting patterns and comparisons. It uses natural language processing (NLP) to understand how stories are told differently across languages.

**In simple terms**: It's like having a super-powered reading assistant that can analyze the same story in different languages and tell you how they compare!

## âœ¨ Features

- **Read and process fables** in multiple languages
- **Compare how stories differ** when told in different languages
- **Analyze writing styles** to see what makes each language unique
- **Explore morals and themes** across cultural tellings
- **Visualize the results** with colorful, easy-to-understand graphs
