A wolf [CHARACTER] once saw a lamb [CHARACTER] who had wandered away from the flock. He  did not want to rush upon the lamb [CHARACTER] and seize him  violently. Instead, he sought a reasonable complaint to justify his hatred. ‘You insulted me last year, when you were small’, said the wolf[CHARACTER]. The lamb[CHARACTER] replied, ‘How could I have insulted you last year[DATE]? I’m not even a year old.’ The wolf[CHARACTER] continued, ‘Well, are you not cropping the grass of this field[LOCATION] which belongs to me?’ The lamb[CHARACTER] said, ‘No, I[CHARACTER] haven’t eaten any grass; I have not even begun to graze.’ Finally the wolf[CHARACTER] exclaimed, ‘But didn’t you drink from the fountain which Idrink from?’ The lamb[CHARACTER] answered, ‘It is my mother’s breast that gives me my drink.’ The wolf[CHARACTER] then seized the lamb[CHARACTER] and as he chewed he said, ‘You are not going to make this wolf[CHARACTER] go without his dinner, even if you are able to easily refute every one of my charges!
