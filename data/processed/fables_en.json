Instead, he sought a reasonable complaint to justify his hatred. ‘You insulted me last year, when you were small’, said the wolf. The lamb replied, ‘How could I have insulted you last year? I’m not even a year old.’ The wolf continued, ‘Well, are you not cropping the grass of this field which belongs to me?’ The lamb said, ‘No, I haven’t eaten any grass; I have not even begun to graze.’ Finally the wolf exclaimed, ‘But didn’t you drink from the fountain which I drink from?’ The lamb answered, ‘It is my mother’s breast that gives me my drink.’ The wolf then seized the lamb and as he chewed he said, ‘You are not going to make this wolf go without his dinner, even if you are able to easily refute every one of my charges!”\n<body>\n<moral></moral>",

The city mouse finished his business in the country, and by means of insistent invitations he persuaded the country mouse to come pay him a visit. The city mouse then brought the country mouse into a room that was overflowing with food. As they were feasting on various delicacies, a butler opened the door. The city mouse quickly concealed himself in a familiar mouse-hole, but the poor country mouse was not acquainted with the house and frantically scurried around the floorboards, frightened out of his wits. When the butler had taken what he needed, he closed the door behind him. The city mouse then urged the country mouse to sit back down to dinner. The country mouse refused and said, ‘How could I possibly do that? Oh, how scared I am! Do you think that the man is going to come”\n“back?’ This was all that the terrified mouse was able to say. The city mouse insisted, ‘My dear fellow, you could never find such delicious food as this anywhere else in the world.’ ‘Acorns are enough for me,’ the country mouse maintained, ‘so long as I am secure in my freedom!”\n<body>\n<moral type=\"explicit\">It is better to live in self-sufficient poverty than to be tormented by the worries of wealth.</moral>",
